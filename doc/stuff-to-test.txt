Network scenarios (normal):
---------------------------

   * Normal network; all hosts up with P=x%:
       `./lib/main.py`
   * Network is down and looks down.
       `./lib/main.py -d`
   * FascistFirewall; only 443 and 80 reachable, P=x%:
       `./lib/main.py -F`
   * User moves among above networks over time.
       `./lib/main.py -S`

Guard behavior:
---------------

These three are not explicitly tested yet, but occur as part of
the normal churn cycle of the simulation:

   * Guard stays up
   * Guard starts up, goes down.
   * Some change over time about which guards are Running/Guard/listed.

And this one needs a parameter added to the options parser in order to
explicitly change it:

   * TODO: Guard goes away and comes back a lot

User behavior:
--------------

   * Regular
       - The default network assumes we're not using bridges.
   * TODO: Bridge
       - There is no simulation for using (or switching to) bridges yet.
   * TODO: FascistFirewall set (by user).
       - The default network assumes it's set to [443,80].
   * TODO: Restart tor (when not working? Repeatedly)
   * TODO: HUP tor (when not working? repeatedly?)

Network scenarios (hostile):
----------------------------

   * Targeted guard takedown attack: attacker hits guards one after another:
       `./lib/main.py -s`
   * Network under broad attack: many guards are flaky
       `./lib/main.py -f`
   * Filtering at gateway; non-hostile fractino of Tor guards is unavailable:
       `./lib/main.py -e`
   * TODO: Filtering at guard: guard blocks connections when it does not control
     path (out of scope?)
